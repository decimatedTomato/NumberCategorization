# Purpose of program

The purpose of this project is to find:
- mathematical properties of specified numbers
- numbers that have specified mathematical properties

## Properties
To start with I am going to include only the aliquot property

>[In mathematics, an aliquot sequence is a sequence of positive integers in which each term is the sum of the proper divisors of the previous term.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliquot_sequence)

Many aliquot sequences end with a prime number which leads to 0.
However there are some that do not terminate
- a perfect number repeats with a period of 1
- amicable number pairs repeat with a period of 2
- sociable numbers repeat with a period >= 3
- aspiring numbers result in a perfect, amicable or sociable number but are not themselves part of the loop

-- TODO add palindromic and prime explanations

## Ideas for extension
- Factorial and primoral property
- Special value for 0 and 1 (I don't know what exactly)

- Add deficient/abundant aliquot sums

Some settings could be parameterized (palindromes in specified base rather than decimal)

Search function for certain criteria including intersection between multiple results
